Hi there 👋

This is Yukun Tian!

It's a pleasure to meet you!  

- 👯 I am now studying at the Southeast University and my major is Artificial Intelligence. (I really love it!😊)  

- 🔭 I’m now focusing on computer vision and machine learning. Currently I am working on event-based vision and multi-modal fusion. (fighting with ddl /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~)  

- 🌱 I am now leading the R&D of my school's Robot Team. (Mainly on vision tasks 👁)  

- ⚡ Hobbies: taking photos, playing badminton, reading...  

- 💬 Feel free to contact me!  

-  ✨ On this website you can find #part# of my engineering and research work, but I will update it as soon as possible! ✨

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
