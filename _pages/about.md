### About me

I am an undergraduate student at Southeast University, under the supervision of Professors Ruiting Zhou and Hao Chen. My academic pursuits primarily focus on **Machine Learning**, with a specialization in **Computer Vision and Multi-modal Learning**. Additionally, I am also deeply interested in **Robotics and mlsys (both training and inference)**. Beyond academics, I am passionate about coding and find great joy in seeing the practical outcomes of my development projects.

### Research Goal
My long-term research goal is to build a machine that can **continuously learn from experiences, knowledge, and environment, and apply this knowledge to address real-world challenges.** (Like *J.A.R.V.I.S.* in *Iron Man*)   
Key features and challenges of this machine would include:
+  Cross-domain multimodal understanding and perception; 
+  Real-time, low-latency responses;
+  Embodied intelligence, capable of decision-making, planning, and action.  

Currently, I am at the beginning of my research journey, with primary focuses the first two challenges of building such a machine. I really want to do two kinds of work: *(i) Project with high influence that is widely used in research and industry community; (ii) Project that focus on fundemantal or vital problems in an area.*

*"Sight turned into insight; Seeing became understanding; Understanding led to action. All these gave rise to intelligence."*
