I completed my internship of nearly three months at Huawei Nanjing Research Center, where I was honored with **Outstanding Student** by the Public Development Department. Also, as a representative, I delivered a speech at the award ceremony to share insights about my internship. The experience there was truly wonderful!🎉🎉🎉
