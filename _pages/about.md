### About me

I am a year 3 undergraduate student at Southeast University. My academic pursuits primarily focus on **Real-World Applicable Intelligent Systems**, with a specialization in **Machine Learning Algorithms and Systems**. Additionally, I am also interested in **Robotics**. Beyond academics, I am passionate about coding and find great joy in seeing the practical outcomes of my development projects.

### Research Goal
My long-term research goal is to build a machine that can **continuously learn from experiences, knowledge, and environment, and apply this knowledge to address real-world challenges.** (Like *J.A.R.V.I.S.* in *Iron Man*)   
Key features and challenges of this machine would include:
+  Cross-domain multimodal understanding and perception; 
+  Real-time, low-latency responses;
+  Embodied intelligence, capable of decision-making, planning, and action.  

Currently, I am at the beginning of my research journey, with primary focuses the first two challenges of building such a machine. I really want to do two kinds of work: *(i) Projects that are widely used in research and industry community; (ii) Projects that focus on fundamental or vital problems in an area.*
