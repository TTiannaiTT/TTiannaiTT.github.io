### About me


I am an undergraduate student at Southeast University, under the supervision of Professors Ruiting Zhou and Hao Chen. My academic focus centers on **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, with a specialization in **Computer Vision and Multi-modal Learning**. Additionally, I am deeply interested in **Robotics and Accelerated Computing**. Outside of my academic work, I am passionate about coding and find great joy in seeing the practical outcomes of my development projects.



### Research Goal
My long-term research goal and dream are to build a machine that can **continuously learn from experiences, knowledge, and environment, and then apply this knowledge to address real-world challenges.** (Maybe like *J.A.R.V.I.S.* in *Iron Man*)   
Key features of this machine would include:
+  Multimodal understanding and perception; 
+  Real-time, low-latency responses;
+  Embodied intelligence, capable of decision-making, planning, and action.  

Currently, I am at the beginning of my research journey, with primary focuses on computer vision, multimodal learning, accelerated computing and robotics —aimed at addressing the challenges of building such a machine.
